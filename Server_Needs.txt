Player object (functional used by the gameManagement)
Arrays for the guesses, 

// message meanings

// player turn, boolean for the array, end of turn send guess. 

// server checks if game has won, if not send boolean array to all clients

// if winner end match and start new match after updating the score. 

// player 1 starts each round. 

// send message to indicate the beginning of the game to the clients


match begin, send each player their player number, reset the board, update scores, 

every round player receives game status, boolean array (grid), int player turn

game status: 1 (in progress), 2 (new match), 3 (game over)

boolean array [0-3] = row1, [4-7] row2, [8-11] row3, [12-15] row4

turn int = 0-3, or 1-4



int guess
boolean array 

boolean array 

// need client panel (gui.gameHome)

// states \\

unconnected -> connected (waiting) -> connected (start game) -> Round (start) 

// Need to send the initial arrays, update guessed array

Round (start) -> update board -> wait for turn -> send guess -> wait for turn -> ... Round (end) -> 10 matches end (Game over)
10 matches end (Game over) -> Display who won

call gui.updateGuesses to set the initial array for each client gui. 


















// from development

Issues: 
~4.5 hours development and testing today. 

message saying which player they are, updatePlayerCount in the GUI

The server address (I could only get 127.0.0.1, which isn't gonna help others connect) --DONE (should be correct, verified on 3 machines)

For client to take the address given in the GUI. (Just realized I haven't made the control for this, I will do this next) --DONE

Somewhere to send the guesses to (either a method to call or you could add something to the submit button part of the action listener, gui.guess stores the last guess made)

The gui will not update the texts after calling updatePlayerCount --fixed

the setup gui for the client will not update after connecting.
